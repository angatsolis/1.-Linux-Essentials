Kernel
======
The Linux® kernel is the main component of a Linux operating system (OS) and is the core interface between a computer’s hardware and its processes.

The kernel has 4 jobs:
- Memory management: Keep track of how much memory is used to store what, and where
- Process management: Determine which processes can use the CPU, when, and for how long
- Device drivers: Act as mediator/interpreter between the hardware and processes
- System calls and security: Receive requests for service from the processes
